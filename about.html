            <h3>Why Fender?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="info-text">
              Fender is my favorite guitar brand because of there high quality build and classic sound. 
              The Fender telecaster and stratocaster are second to none in the world of guitar. If you see
              someone playing live they are most likely playing a Fender. Of course the high quality wood,
              craftsmanship, and eloctronics all come at a high price but they do offer cheaper options with 
              their Squier brand of guitars.

            <h3>Stratocaster</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="info-text">
              The stratocaster type body is one of Fenders original designs made in 1954. The guitar 
              was made with gentle deep contours that allowed for easier and more comfortable playing. It 
              featured 3 single coil pick-ups with a 3 way pick-up selector, later being changed 
              to a 5 way selector. The strat also released with an improved tremolo bar over the Bigsby tremelo.
              Stratocasters can be seen everywhere and is in every guitarists lineup, many famous guitarists 
              used strats, such as Eric Clapton, Jimmy Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Buddy Holly, and David Gilmour.

            <h3>Telecaster</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="info-text">
              The telecaster body was Fender's first original design of an electric guitar, it was made in 
              1951. It was revolutionary the classic cutaway body made a whole new way to play gutair, while 
              it wasn't the first electric guitar it was the first to have that slim solid body type that is 
              widely known and used today. Telecasters are known as one of the most versatile instruments ranging 
              from playing jazz to counrty to rock and many more genres. Jimmy Paige is probably the most notable 
              telecaster player. This style is tried and true and has hardly ever changed, it's iconic headstock 
              and it's classic single coil pick-up sound has never changed. The only changes have been to the brigde
              mechanism but the original 3 saddle style is still used today on many of them.
